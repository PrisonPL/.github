# [PrisonPL](https://github.com/PrisonPL)
This is a project by `CollidaCube` to create all sorts of plugins to cover common Prison server features, such as:
- Custom economies/statistics
- Custom tools
- Custom enchants
- Public/Private mines

Not all of these are a reality yet, but it is a work in progress.
